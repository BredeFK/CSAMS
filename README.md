# Computer Science Assignment Management System

## Setup guides
- In openstack, create instance and security group.
- Security group should open port 80 (for http access) and possibly 8080 if you want to access adminer for database management
- In a fresh linux instance, install Docker, Git and Make
- ``` sudo apt-get update ```
- ``` sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io ```
- ``` sudo apt-get install build-essential ```
- ``` sudo apt-get install git ```
- Clone this repo through https: ``` git clone https://github.com/JohanAanesen/CSAMS.git ```
- Edit the Makefile to change envvars for passwords and email authentication (do not commit these changes to git)
- Save the changes locally so you can copy paste them in again if you're running a new instance.
- run 'sudo make new' to apply envvars and build the service
- I highly recommend mounting the server instance to physical storage through openstack, this way you should be able to extract the database even if everything crashes.

### Importing old database
- If this is a fresh instance then you will have to open port 8080 and access adminer
- Click 'SQL Command'
- Open your exported database file and paste it in there
- There will probably be some issue because of FAQ table, but that doesn't matter unless you have updated anything, then you should manually override it somehow.

### Exporting database
- Access adminer through port 8080
- Click the 'Export' button
- Output should be 'open'
- Format SQL
- Database BLANK
- Tables BLANK
- Data INSERT
- Select all tables
- Click export and use ctrl+s to save the data

### Service crash recover
- If the server crashes for some unknown reason, run 'sudo make restart'
- Verify that the database has been attached/re-mounted, if this doesn't work, restart it again.
- If it still doesn't work, run 'sudo make stop' and 'sudo make run'
- It's recommended to do a database export when the server is running again to assure data won't be lost.

### When updating the code/server
- Export the database before updating the server (as a precausion)
- run sudo git pull
- Forfeit any local changes
- Run the server with 'sudo make build'
- once it's running, run 'sudo make resart' to restart the service and attach the already existing database
- Verify that the database has been attached (try to login or check adminer)
- If not import the database previously exported.

This project is in the norwegian timezone!
### SQL
Uses the Go function below combined with `ConvertTimeStampToString(time.Time)`
### GO
[`webservice/shared/util/time.go`](https://github.com/JohanAanesen/CSAMS/blob/master/webservice/shared/util/time.go)
```Go
func GetTimeInNorwegian() time.Time {
	//init the loc
	loc, _ := time.LoadLocation("Europe/Oslo")

	return time.Now().In(loc)
}
```
### Javascript
[`webservice/static/js/time.js`](https://github.com/JohanAanesen/CSAMS/blob/master/webservice/static/js/time.js)
```Js
function getTimeInNorwegian() {
    let norTime = new Date().toLocaleString("no-no", {timeZone: "Europe/Oslo"});
    return new Date(norTime);
}
```


## Commit messages guideline
Start with the number `#42` where the number is the number to the `card` you're working on Trello followed by:
* update	- updated function/file
* add	- added function/file
* fix	- fixed a bug
* remove	- removed a function/file
* test	- added a test for a function
* refactor - refactored the code-structure, moved a file or changed the visual representation of code.

Aka #CARDNR ACTION BRIEF_EXPLANATION

Examples:
* "#2 add database.sql initial table file"
* "#8 fix changing password bug"
* "#14 update weekly report for week 2"

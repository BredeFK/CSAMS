## Week 8 report
#### Worked on
* I have been working on the assignment and submission features for the lecturer-side of the software.
* Making the forms for creating the submission and review-forms dynamic. Doing this with Javascript, 
making a small reusable library with some configuration.
* Database for the dynamic form
#### Decisions
* The database tables were changed a few times throughout the week, but I think the last version
will be more suited for the application, as it is scalable.
#### Good
* Got the story done, and feel the way it ended up, will be good for the rest of the application,
making it scalable for other types of submissions, and assignments.
#### Bad
* Used to much time on this story
* Had problems with the database, cause of old relations, making it hard to merge new tables together with old once. 

## 22/02/2019
* Did some QoL on the form submits
* Fixed some bugs of redirecting and form-validation
* Researched best practice for Go

#### Research examples
Simple example with `Courses`

Go-code:
```go
package research

type Course struct {
	ID int
	Data map[string]string
}

// Current usage
type Courses struct {
	Items []Courses
}

// Researched usage
type Courses []Courses
```

HTML-code:
```html
<!-- Current usage -->
{{range .Courses.Items}}
    <div class="col">...</div>
{{end}}

<!-- Researched usage -->
{{range .Courses}}
    <div class="col">...</div>
{{end}}
```

## 20/02/2019
* Created a working tables for the assignments, submissions, forms and fields.
* Did pull request on a bigger card, but group found a lot of bugs, got most of them fixed
* Found a new way of doing the `forms` and `fields` tables:
#### `forms`
| id | prefix | name | description | created |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PK | prefix for fields (HTML ) | Display name | Description .. | TIMESTAMP |

#### `fields`
| id | form_id  | type | name | label | description | priority | weight | choices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PK | FK | type of field (text, radio, checkbox) | Name of field (HTML) | Label (Display name) | Description | Order number | Weight for grading | Choices (Array, split by ',')

## 19/02/2019
* Short day of working. Got the basic framework for the dynamic form together

## 18/02/2019
* Talked with product owner about the database-design for the custom forms, and found a solution together that will not be too hard to implement.
  * Later found a more generic way to design the database, with a `forms` and `fields` table:
  
#### Forms-table
| id  | name | description | created | prefix |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| PK  | Display name | Description .. | TIMESTAMP | prefix for fields (HTML)
#### Fields-table
| id | data | order | form_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PK | JSON | needed? | FK for `forms` |

## Week 7 Report
This week I have been looking into data structure for the dynamic review form, and where and what should take care for the input/output for the form. From the research done, it seams like Javascript will be the best choice of creating and parsing data to strings, with JSON, as Javascript is well-equipped with JSON-functions.

The database is also a challenge, because of the dynamic form, the database has to be design for a agile software, that needs to be flexible today, as well in a few years. I think I have found a good solution for the desgin of the database, but it is hard to implement cause of the auto-generated schema we are using from MySQL Workbench, but I think we need to rewrite the database-schema, and look more into normalization of relational databases, to make it flexible enough for the requirement-specs.

Have also been working on the last touches of the restructuring of the project, making it more flexible with a MVC-architecture. Making less files, and all the files in a folder, does the same type of tasks.  

## 15/02/2019
* Updated teh time.Time convert-function from datetime-local (HTML).
* Looked at the database for assignments, 

## 14/02/2019
* Worked on the design of assignments with the peer reviews, thinking about the data-structure, and how to store it, and where it should be written/read.

## 13/02/2019
* Worked on the assignments page for admins, looking at data-structure, and an easy approach for designing the form.

## 12/02/2019
* Worked on restructuring the folder-/file-structure for the project. Making it a MVC-structure.

## 11/02/2019
* Started the planning for the project restructure, for a more efficient development later on in the project.

# Week 6 Report
I have worked mainly with Bootstrap to get a concise design on every page of the application. Templating has also taken up quite a bit of time, as I did not have much knowledge of this before, and had to read about this, and talk to the other team members about this issue. It was resolved in a straightforward way, but afterwards I see that it could have been solved even better, with the creation of features to simply enter simple parameters to be able to change the whole page, as well as help reuse code.

I have also worked part with the dynamic form to be used for peer review. Since I have a good deal of knowledge from before with dynamic front-end programming, this task went pretty smoothly. Met some challenges with the prioritization of fields, but found a solution in the end that makes it easy for both me and the person who will set up the form. Will look later on this, but it works pretty well as it does now. Only thing missing is adding a button to remove items from the form.

The group had a discussion on the database structure and form structure of the application, and found that we could reduce the number of fields in the database, using Markdown as word processing, which means that user has great freedom in relation to text and content that can added to the subject page.

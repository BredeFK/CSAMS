# The Log of Bread
<!-- By BredeFK -->
## Week One
### Monday - 04/02/19
 *Started late today because of Super Bowl airing until 04.00 at the night.*
* Finished setting up the environment.
* Started working/preparing for task 8(User Profile).
* Watched a tutorial about bootstrap.

### Tuesday - 05/02/19
* Continued working on the design for the user profile page.
* Had a bug about not getting the data from go file to html file. I fixed it with changing the struct variables to have capital letters :)))
* Almost finished with #8, just need to get actual user information and actually change the information.
* if the user wants to change information, it happens on the same side.
* information is displayed in input element for making the changes easier.

### Wednesday - 06/02/19
*I overslept 45min today, but that's fine, I'm just working 1h 45min longer :)*
* I found a bug yesterday with adding a secondary email, that I need to fix today
* A new bug about the form in `user.html` is sending unvalidated input to the handler. I/we choose to not fix this not, but added an TODO to fix it later :) 
* We were a bit unsure how to update user user information. Since you can choose to only change one thing or all the information, should we request a change to the db for each change or all together every time?
    * Solution: Different queries to different changes
* Another bug with getting the password-hash from the DB, it only works when the secondary-email is not NULL (*I think*).
    * Solution: Ask [Johan](https://github.com/JohanAanesen) for help.
    * He kinda fixed it with `sql.Nullstring`, it still doesn't work right :/
* Today was just bug after bug, not a fun day, I also worked an hour longer so I can leave earlier on Friday.

### Thursday - 07/02/19
*I overslept 30min today, I was supposed to start one hour earlier.*
* The real courses show up on the profile now :D 
* I had to make an own function for getting the password hash because of an annoying bug >:(
* User can now change, secondary email, name and password :D
* Only need to refactor some code, write some tests and lint and add some confirmation that the information is changed
* Fixed error where the page went blank after submitting form. It was solved by requesting the view function to start again.
* Didn't work a full day today because not good :/

### Friday - 08/02/19
*I'm going home today to celebrate my birthday, so I'm leaving 2hours earlier*
* Fixed the hash bug, [Johan](https://github.com/JohanAanesen) saw that i 'fixed' it on the wrong variable so now the hash appeared too!
* Fixed the input validation bug, I had to switch from `onclick` to `onsubmit` that started the javascript script in the button-save. 
* Merged with master and got some problems, but [Johan](https://github.com/JohanAanesen) helped me fix it.
* Almost done with #8 now, only need some refactoring and I have to fix one test.

### Sunday - 10/02/19
*I'm 5h too short for this week, so I have to work some today too*
* Started up with setting up the environment on my laptop since I'm home and not in Gj√∏vik.
* I'm going to fix one test today and [Johan](https://github.com/JohanAanesen) is refactoring the code, so after that, I can make a pull request.
* Merged my branch to master

## Week Two
### Monday - 11/02/19
* Started on [#16 - Logging to database](https://trello.com/c/CwIxfhpk) - Log stuff that the user and/or admin does
* Everything went fine for now at least, that's nice üòç
* Had two meetings and plan to discuss new project structure
* I made a powershell script that runs go fmt,vet,lint,cyclo and test. I did it to make the linting/testing go faster and more "clean"

### Tuesday - 12/02/19
* I started on looking how the logs table will be.
* I created an struct for keeping the log data for easier use and fewer parameters.
* Logs when the user change name/email/password now.
* bug: Added foreign keys to logs, if course,submission or assignment id is blank, it doesnt work.
So I have to figure out how to send nil instead of a number to the db.
* I know one way to fix the bug, but it's to much and messy code :/ (hella many if-else), and that would be to awful.
* This day went more to thinking about how to solve something than actually do it

### Wednesday - *Birthday edition* 13/02/19
*Woooo birthday boi, halfway to 44*
* I still had a bug with adding nil instead of int to the db with #16. I solved it with creating nasty
if-else statements, I hope to refactor it later.
* I also commented a lot for the function so it's more clear how to use it :D
* Pushed #16 to master and started on #23. Need to fix homepage first tho :/
* I'm unsure of how to go further as the home page seem to just be empty on purpose and other stuff.
* I think I can finish tomorrow tho <3
* Nothing much happened today :/

### Thursday - 14/02/19
*I am 22 now, also the power went out home, so I went to the School of NTNU*
* Started on restoring home page, currently stuck in a bug where the post function in index.go won't start.
* I can now check if with a given course id, if it exists.
* I need to figure out how to confirm that the user joined a class. I want to start an js script from go :/
    * Solution: Global variable and send to template
* Can now add user to course through home page :D
* Course have an unique ID now, got inspiration form [here](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/JyRZ/generating-good-unique-ids-in-go.html), 
I chose `github.com/rs/xid` because it was the length i wanted and quick and easy to use.
* Added logging for create/join course

### Friday - 15/02/19
* Added functionality for adding user to course through link when the user is logged in and when the user logs in.
* Added functionality for adding a new user to course through link.
* Added a test for RegisterGET handler :)
* Short day I guess, I'm going to write the report today, also -> no bugs today woo.

## Week Three
### Monday - 18/02/19
* \#23 Changed courseID back to int and auto increment so it's similar to the other tables. But i added a column for hash instead.
* \#20 Started on home page, but could only finish one of two tasks since assignments isn't done yet.
* We almost didn't have anything to talk about today with the [supervisor](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/ivar.farup).
* I'm going to start on [#22 - Admin FAQ Page](https://trello.com/c/0trVQS8x) now :D
* \#22 Looked at [this page](https://www.codeply.com/go/syFXJL6m5p/bootstrap-4-faq-accordion) for inspiration to the faq page, I liked the animations and stuff, but... If I use markdown instead
it would be way easier to just add a new faq in frontend and is over all less code and easier to implement. Agreed with [Project Owner](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/christopher.frantz)
to use md, it's also more consistence with this solution.
* Have to find out if we just store a hardcoded md file for faqs or make it possible to edit in the front-end by any teacher tomorrow.

### Tuesday - 19/02/19
* \#22 Decided on storing the md in db and let any teacher edit it, but also log every update.
* I chose to copy some of the design [Johan](https://github.com/JohanAanesen) used for course page to keep it more constance all over <3 
* I have some bugs on the faq site, but the main functionality is all done soon.
* I also moved db functions from shared/db to model and gave a temp fix to the extremely annoying go lint errors...
* All functions for faq is now done, each time a teacher updates the faq, the time is added **IN NORWEGIAN TIME**, this has to be written somewhere
as we talked about with the [Project Owner](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/christopher.frantz) yesterday.

### Wednesday - 20/02/19
* \#22 Tried to switch to a new package to get the text in the textarea editor to show, it still didn't work >:(
    * I think the problem is that id doesn't load again when the tab is shown.
    * It was bootstrap all along :'( 
    * I fixed the problem by removing the tabs and having the edit page on it's on page.
    * I also changed the design so it's more consistence to the admin dashboard.
    * Not really sure how to write tests for \#22 yet so I'll leave that for later.
    * Finished for now
* Started on [#21 - Admin Page Dynamic](https://trello.com/c/J8GQvTCt)
* Used some time looking at a pull request
* Updated the getCoursesToUser to get the courses sorted by the year and then semester in descending order.
It's nicer this way and more effective to have current classes at the top where they are easy reachable.
### ~~Thursday - 21/02/19~~ Ski day!
### Friday - 22/02/19
*Ski day was rough*
* Looked at pull request
* \#21 Merged main to branch
* Displaying courses and assignments in dashboard, course and assignment for admin now. I need to make assignments in sorted order by deadline
and display only active courses and assignments on dashboard, and then I'm done.

## Week Four - One month woo
### Monday - 25/02/19
* Continuing the work on \#21
* \#21 I created a new function in `model/assignment.go` called `GetAllToUserSorted()` which gets all the assignment to the user
sorted by the deadlines desc.

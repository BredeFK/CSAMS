# The Log of Bread
<!-- By BredeFK -->
## Week One
### Monday - 04/02/19
 *Started late today because of Super Bowl airing until 04.00 at the night.*
* Finished setting up the environment.
* Started working/preparing for task 8(User Profile).
* Watched a tutorial about bootstrap.

### Tuesday - 05/02/19
* Continued working on the design for the user profile page.
* Had a bug about not getting the data from go file to html file. I fixed it with changing the struct variables to have capital letters :)))
* Almost finished with #8, just need to get actual user information and actually change the information.
* if the user wants to change information, it happens on the same side.
* information is displayed in input element for making the changes easier.

### Wednesday - 06/02/19
*I overslept 45min today, but that's fine, I'm just working 1h 45min longer :)*
* I found a bug yesterday with adding a secondary email, that I need to fix today
* A new bug about the form in `user.html` is sending unvalidated input to the handler. I/we choose to not fix this not, but added an TODO to fix it later :) 
* We were a bit unsure how to update user user information. Since you can choose to only change one thing or all the information, should we request a change to the db for each change or all together every time?
    * Solution: Different queries to different changes
* Another bug with getting the password-hash from the DB, it only works when the secondary-email is not NULL (*I think*).
    * Solution: Ask Johan for help.
    * He kinda fixed it with `sql.Nullstring`, it still doesn't work right :/
* Today was just bug after bug, not a fun day, I also worked an hour longer so I can leave earlier on Friday.

### Thursday - 07/02/19
*I overslept 30min today, I was supposed to start one hour earlier.*
* The real courses show up on the profile now :D 
* I had to make an own function for getting the password hash because of an annoying bug >:(
* User can now change, secondary email, name and password :D
* Only need to refactor some code, write some tests and lint and add some confirmation that the information is changed
* Fixed error where the page went blank after submitting form. It was solved by requesting the view function to start again.
* Didn't work a full day today because not good :/

### Friday - 08/02/19
*I'm going home today to celebrate my birthday, so I'm leaving 2hours earlier*
* Fixed the hash bug, Johan saw that i 'fixed' it on the wrong variable so now the hash appeared too!
* Fixed the input validation bug, I had to switch from `onclick` to `onsubmit` that started the javascript script in the button-save. 
* Merged with master and got some problems, but Johan helped me fix it.
* Almost done with #8 now, only need some refactoring and I have to fix one test.

### Sunday - 10/02/19
*I'm 5h too short for this week, so I have to work some today too*
* Started up with setting up the environment on my laptop since I'm home and not in Gj√∏vik.
* I'm going to fix one test today and Johan is refactoring the code, so after that, I can make a pull request.
* Merged my branch to master

## Week Two
### Monday - 11/02/19
* Started on [#16 - Logging to database](https://trello.com/c/CwIxfhpk) - Log stuff that the user and/or admin does
* Everything went fine for now at least, that's nice üòç
* Had two meetings and plan to discuss new project structure
* I made a powershell script that runs go fmt,vet,lint,cyclo and test. I did it to make the linting/testing go faster and more "clean"

### Tuesday - 12/02/19
* I started on looking how the logs table will be.
* I created an struct for keeping the log data for easier use and fewer parameters.
* Logs when the user change name/email/password now.
* bug: Added foreign keys to logs, if course,submission or assignment id is blank, it doesnt work.
So I have to figure out how to send nil instead of a number to the db.
* I know one way to fix the bug, but it's to much and messy code :/ (hella many if-else), and that would be to awful.
* This day went more to thinking about how to solve something than actually do it

### Wednesday - *Birthday edition* 13/02/19
*Woooo birthday boi, halfway to 44*
* I still had a bug with adding nil instead of int to the db with #16. I solved it with creating nasty
if-else statements, I hope to refactor it later.
* I also commented a lot for the function so it's more clear how to use it :D
* Pushed #16 to master and started on #23. Need to fix homepage first tho :/
* I'm unsure of how to go further as the home page seem to just be empty on purpose and other stuff.
* I think I can finish tomorrow tho <3
* Nothing much happened today :/

### Thursday - 14/02/19
*I am 22 now, also the power went out home, so I went to the School of NTNU*
* Started on restoring home page, currently stuck in a bug where the post function in index.go won't start.
* I can now check if with a given course id, if it exists.
* I need to figure out how to confirm that the user joined a class. I want to start an js script from go :/
    * Solution: Global variable and send to template
* Can now add user to course through home page :D
* Course have an unique ID now, got inspiration form [here](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/JyRZ/generating-good-unique-ids-in-go.html), 
I chose `github.com/rs/xid` because it was the length i wanted and quick and easy to use.
* Added logging for create/join course

### Friday - 15/02/19
* Added functionality for adding user to course through link when the user is logged in and when the user logs in.
* Added functionality for adding a new user to course through link.
* Added a test for RegisterGET handler :)
* Short day I quess, I'm going to write the report today, also -> no bugs today woo.

## Week Three
### Monday - 18/02/19
* \#23 Changed courseID back to int and auto increment so it's similar to the other tables. But i added a column for hash instead.
* \#20 Started on home page, but could only finish one of two tasks since assignments isn't done yet.
* We almost didn't have anything to talk about today with the supervisor.
* I'm going to start on [#22 - Admin FAQ Page](https://trello.com/c/0trVQS8x) now :D
* \#22 Looked at [this page](https://www.codeply.com/go/syFXJL6m5p/bootstrap-4-faq-accordion) for inspiration to the faq page, I liked the animations and stuff, but... If I use markdown instead
it would be way easier to just add a new faq in frontend and is over all less code and easier to implement. Agreed with [Project Owner](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/christopher.frantz)
to use md, it's also more consistence with this solution.
* Have to find out if we just store a hardcoded md file for faqs or make it possible to edit in the front-end by any teacher tomorrow.

### Tuesday - 19/02/19
* \#22 Decided on storing the md in db and let any teacher edit it, but also log every update.
* I chose to copy some of the design Johan used for course page to keep it more constance all over <3 
* I have some bugs on the faq site, but the main functionality is all done soon.
* I also moved db functions from shared/db to model and gave a temp fix to the extremely annoying go lint errors...
* All functions for faq is now done, each time a teacher updates the faq, the time is added **IN NORWEGIAN TIME**, this has to be written somewhere
as we talked about with the [Project Owner](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/christopher.frantz) yesterday.

### Wednesday - 20/02/19
* \#22 Tried to switch to a new package to get the text in the textarea editor to show, it still didn't work >:(
    * I think the problem is that id doesn't load again when the tab is shown.
    * It wass bootstrap all along :'(

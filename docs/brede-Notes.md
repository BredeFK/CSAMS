 *Started late today because of Super Bowl airing until 04.00 at the night.*
* Finished setting up the environment.
* Started working/preparing for task 8(User Profile).
* Watched a tutorial about bootstrap.

### Tuesday - 05/02/19
* Continued working on the design for the user profile page.
* Had a bug about not getting the data from go file to html file. I fixed it with changing the struct variables to have capital letters :)))
* Almost finished with #8, just need to get actual user information and actually change the information.
* if the user wants to change information, it happens on the same side.
* information is displayed in input element for making the changes easier.
